# car_explore_map

We make the car explore the map without knowing the appearance of the map.

This is more reasonable since the map should be inlnown for most of the time.

In this project, we use DFS to explore the inknown map, and apply ultrasound model to check the availability of four directions.

In the end, we will output the route explored by the car by turtle model.
